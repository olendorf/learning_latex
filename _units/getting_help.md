## Getting Help.

LaTeX can be a little daunting and frustrating. While simple to use, there are
so many packages available and so many different ways to extend it, that it
can be difficult to know what you can do. Additionally, the error messages are
often less then helpful. Fortunately, given its widespread use there is also
a lot of help.

### Tex StackExchange

StackExchange is a network of websites of which Tex is one. You may have run 
across StackOverflow before as well. They are all similar in that users post 
questions that are answered by other users. The questions and answers can 
be upvoted and downvoted so that you can usually find the best answer to 
a question. 

### Documentation

OverLeaf itself has a fair amount of documentation and tutorials. It is a good
idea to make use of these. Also, if you do use external packages, and you 
probably will, they come with their own documenation. Usually its pretty good.
There are also a number of other tutorials online.

### Finding Answers and Troubleshooting

As with any computer language, errors and bugs happen. As noted above, and as 
you may have experienced, the error messages are often not so useful. However,
you are almost certainly not the first person to have experienced it. The
best thing to do is to start with with a web search. In most cases the top 
answers will be something from StackExchange, OverLeaf, or the LaTeX 
documentation from LaTeX or the documenation from the package in question.
Over time, you will build up knowledge and experience as well. You will
either learn the answers to the errors, or at least get better at finding them!
