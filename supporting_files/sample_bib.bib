   abstract = {Previous behavioral studies have shown that individuals with autism are less hindered by interference from global processing during the performance of lower-level perceptual tasks, such as finding embedded figures. The primary goal of this study was to examine the brain manifestation of such atypicality in high-functioning autism using fMRI. Fifteen participants with high-functioning autism and fifteen age- and IQ-matched typical controls were asked to perform a lower-level perceptual line-counting task in the presence of a distracting depiction of a 3-D object, in which participants counted whether there were more red or more green contours (In a contrasting 3-D task, participants judged whether the same 3-D stimulus objects (but without color in any contours) depicted a possible or impossible 3-D object). We hypothesized that individuals with autism would be less likely than controls to process the global 3-D information (and would hence show fewer neural signs of such interfering 3},

   abstract = {Age-related changes in resting-state (RS) neural rhythms in typically developing children (TDC) but not children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggest that RS measures may be of clinical use in ASD only for certain ages. The study examined this issue via assessing RS peak alpha frequency (PAF), a measure previous studies, have indicated as abnormal in ASD. RS magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data were obtained from 141 TDC (6.13-17.70 years) and 204 ASD (6.07-17.93 years). A source model with 15 regional sources projected the raw MEG surface data into brain source space. PAF was identified in each participant from the source showing the largest amplitude alpha activity (7-13 Hz). Given sex differences in PAF in TDC (females > males) and relatively few females in both groups, group comparisons were conducted examining only male TDC (N = 121) and ASD (N = 183). Regressions showed significant group slope differences, with an age-related increase in PAF in TDC (R 2 = 0.32) but not ASD},

Both impervious surface coverage and tree canopy coverage increased the risk of severe anxiety in youth with autism, but not CSHCN or typical children. Children with ASD might experience the stress-reducing benefits of nature differently than their typically developing peers.

   abstract = {It is well established that children with autism often show outstanding visual search skills. To date, however, no study has tested whether these skills, usually assessed on a table-top or computer, translate to more true-to-life settings. One prominent account of autism, Baron-Cohen's "systemizing" theory, gives us good reason to suspect that they should. In this study, we tested whether autistic children's exceptional skills at small-scale search extend to a large-scale environment and, in so doing, tested key claims of the systemizing account. Twenty school-age children with autism and 20 age- and ability-matched typical children took part in a large-scale search task in the "foraging room": a purpose-built laboratory, with numerous possible search locations embedded into the floor. Children were instructed to search an array of 16 (green) locations to find the hidden (red) target as quickly as possible. The distribution of target locations was manipulated so that they appeared on },

This study examined the relationship between green space and childhood autism prevalence. Autism count data in 2010 were obtained for 543 of ~ 560 public elementary school districts in California. Multiple types of green space were measured in each school district, including percentages of forest, grassland, and average tree canopy and near-road tree canopy. Their associations with autism prevalence were evaluated with negative binomial regression models and spatial regression models. We observed inverse associations between several green space metrics and autism prevalence in school districts with high road density, the highly urbanized areas, but not in others. According to negative binomial regression models, adjusted rate ratios (RR) for the relationships in these school districts between autism prevalence and green space m},

   abstract = {Trail degradation is a common management problem in protected areas, especially those that accommodate high levels of trail users or organized sporting events. Trail running became popular in Hong Kong in the early 2000s, with a number of trail running events involving large numbers of runners organized in recent years. Although trail competitions are believed to produce very intense impacts on trails and their surrounding environments, limited research exists to quantify and characterize these impacts to inform policy and management responses. This study empirically examined and evaluated the impacts generated by a running competition on a remote trail in Hong Kong. Results indicated that a running competition can cause significant initial degradation on the trail. Although some degradation features (e.g., incision) can recover in 6 months, some negative effects (e.g., soil coarsening) can persist or worsen. It is recommended that trail running competitions should be regulated in protected areas in terms of both number of events and number of participants. Trail maintenance is crucially important for keeping the protected areas in good condition.},
